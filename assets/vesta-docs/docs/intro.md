# Overview
Vesta Protocol is a smart contracting platform designed with developer experience in mind. Writing smart contracts in 
Javascript allows developers to deploy their smart contracts and front-ends in the same language. Furthermore, a 
scripting language allows smart contracts to be developed more quickly as prototypes for apps that can be incubated into
sovereign cosmos chains.

The contracts are stored in plain text and interpreted on runtime
allowing for code auditability and composability. Unlike other smart contract platforms, vesta allows developers to
assign names to smart contract instances and import functions from other contracts by name rather than address. View
